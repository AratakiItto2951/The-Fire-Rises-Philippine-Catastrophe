 PHI_legacy_of_the_martial_law_idea_desc: "The Martial Law, and by extension the presidency of the now dead Ferdinand Marcos remains a controversial topic in mainstream Philippine politics as his autocratic policies have left a scarring mark that would last up to this day."
 PHI_mutual_defence_treaty_idea: "Mutual Defense Treaty"
 PHI_mutual_defence_treaty_idea_desc: "The Mutual Defense Treaty is a comprehensive agreement signed between the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines during its early years of independence marked by communist insurgencies. The question remains if the MDT is going to stay as Duterte's pivot to China would affect its relationship with America. "
 PHI_increasing_chinese_influence_idea: "Increasing Chinese Influence"
 PHI_increasing_chinese_influence_idea_desc: "Ever since President Duterte's attempts at warming relations with the People's Republic of China, Chinese Investment has begun to increase as Chinese Loans are being used to fund the infrastructure programs designed to improve the Philippines, or at least it's image. However, it is criticized by many as a dangerous move that would leave the Philippines vulnerable to subversion by the CCP as the country is having its territorial dispute with China itself."
